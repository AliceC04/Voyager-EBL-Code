# MATLAB code for EBL instrument 
Use this code on a computer connected to an EBL system in order to carry out our experiment. 

For the code to function, it is necessary to have downloaded the Raith_GDSII MATLABtoolkit. It is available on https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/Raith_GDSII

It should be noted that 2 lines, containing a path function, ought to be changed uponuse. The first time, the path to the Raith_GDSII-master file should be inserted into the"addpath()" function. The second time, the path to the .csf file has to be inserted intothe "P_path()" function.
